    If ``filetype`` is not provided, this will try to retreive the ``filetype``
    from the file's ``attrs``. If the file does not exist yet, an IOError will
    be raised if ``filetype`` is not provided.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        The filename to load.
    mode : str, optional
        What mode to load the file with, e.g., 'w' for write, 'r' for read,
        'a' for append. Default will default to h5py.File's mode, which is 'a'.
    filetype : str, optional
        Force the file to be loaded with the given class name. This must be
        provided if creating a new file.

    Returns
    -------
    filetype instance
        An open file handler to the file. The class used for IO with the file
        is determined by the ``filetype`` keyword (if provided) or the
        ``filetype`` stored in the file (if not provided).
